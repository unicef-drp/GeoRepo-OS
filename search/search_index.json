By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p> <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.</p> <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.</p> <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"about/license/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"about/license/#0-definitions","title":"0.

ReactJS React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like <code>Thumbnail</code>, <code>LikeButton</code>, and <code>Video</code>. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps. MUI Move faster with intuitive React UI tools. MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components. Docker Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications. Docker helps developers build, share, and run applications anywhere \u2014 without tedious environment configuration or management. Celery Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. It\u2019s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling. Celery Beat This extension enables you to store the periodic task schedule in your database. The periodic tasks can be managed from the Django Admin interface, where you can create, edit and delete periodic tasks and how often they should run. Django Rest Framework Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. MapLibre Open-source mapping libraries for web and mobile app developers. deck.gl is a WebGL-powered framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets. PostGIS PostGIS extends the capabilities of the PostgreSQL relational database by adding support storing, indexing and querying geographic data. PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. Tegola An open source vector tile server written in Go, Tegola takes geospatial data and slices it into vector tiles that can be efficiently delivered to any client. GDAL GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats.

A module is an artifact that groups geospatial datasets that share similar features and concepts. For example, the module \"Admin Boundaries\" includes all the datasets related to admin boundaries, including the \"official UNICEF admin boundaries dataset\", as well as admin boundaries datasets from other organizations and institutions.</p> <p>A dataset is organized in views. A view is a concept similar to an SQL view, it is a way of seeing a specific portion of a dataset. For example, for a given dataset, there will be a view to access the whole dataset (including previous versions), a view to see only the most recent version of the dataset, and views defined by users to access only specific portions of the dataset.</p> <p>Finally, the data. A view is composed of a set of geographical entities, whose meaning depends on the specific module. For example, the \"Admin Boundaries\" will contain a hierarchy of countries and their administrative divisions. In this context, a geographical entity is a country when it belongs to level 0 of the hierarchy, or an administrative division of a country when it belongs to other levels of the hierarchy.</p> <p>This means that the API will grant access to the dataset through views.</p> <p>For a given geographical entities, GeoRepo provides two kinds of identifiers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Concept identifiers (C-Ucodes) at the level of a geographical     concept. A geographical concept represents a geographical entity,     regardless of the shapefiles attached or the versioning in the     system. For example, \"New York City\". The C-Ucode is more readable     than a UUID and includes the information about the level 0 entity     (ISO3) code and then a progressive number to make the code unique.     For example, #USA153674.</p> </li> <li> <p>Versioned identifiers (Ucodes) for each version of a     concept. GeoRepo is a versioning system, so any time there is an     upload, new boundaries are compared with the existing ones and if     the level of similarity is high enough, a new version of boundaries     is created for a concept. For example, after three uploads, \"New     York City\" will have three versions of boundaries, V1, V2, and V3,     where V3 is the latest version. The geometries may also be the same     for all the versions because it's an upload that causes an increment     of the version and so the adoption of a new Ucode, even though the     upload contains a different geometry. The Ucode is a unique     identifier that represents a specific version. A version has a time     range of validity, so given the C-Ucode of a concept, we can always     access the version of boundaries that was valid at a specific date.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\ud83d\udcd4 Note that other identifiers (like PCodes, WFP codes, ISO3CD, GID, etc.) can be available within the data if they have been uploaded together with the data. On the other end, Ucodes and C-Ucodes are managed directly by GeoRepo and can be used to query the API.</p> <p>Let's see how to use the API and what sequence of API calls can lead us to the discovery of geographical entities.</p>"},{"location":"user/api/guide/#how-to-authenticate-to-the-api","title":"How to authenticate to the API","text":"<p>\ud83d\udd10 API_KEY: access public data</p>"},{"location":"user/api/guide/#generating-an-api-key","title":"Generating an API KEY","text":"<p>Go to the Profile page and click on the <code>API KEY ENROLMENT</code> tab.</p> <p></p> <p>Fill in the details (Platform, Owner, and Contact) and click on the <code>Generate API Key</code> button.
